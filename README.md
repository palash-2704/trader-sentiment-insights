## 📦 Requirements

Install required libraries via:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy

trader_path = r"C:\Users\ACER\Downloads\historical_data.csv"
```

## 🧪 How to Run

Simply run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:

* Load and preprocess both datasets
* Generate multiple visualizations (saved in `/plots`)
* Perform statistical modeling and correlation analysis
* Print actionable trading insights

## 📈 Example Visualizations

* `timeseries_sentiment_pnl.png`: Aggregate daily PnL and sentiment index
* `heatmap_pnl_side_sentiment.png`: Average PnL by trade direction vs. sentiment
* `top_traders_win_rate.png`: How top traders perform across sentiment types
* `profitability_vs_sentiment.png`: Profitability distribution across sentiment index

---

## 💡 Key Insights (Sample)

* **Buy during Extreme Fear** conditions often results in higher win rates.
* **Sell during Extreme Greed** may be more profitable but riskier.
* **Monitor 7-day sentiment average** for better trend prediction.
